# doc-pic-classifier

## Problem
We want to build a model that can classify n types of Documents (in picture format), generated from Document Template. Each Document Template would have elements such as text blocks, input fields, image placeholders etc.

## Data
Input data is generated by [doc pic generator](https://github.com/mr5iff/doc-pic-classifier/tree/master/doc_pic_generator), it takes in jinja2 templates to generate html, and then further convert to png. Stored under data folder.

## Model
Details in `/model/notebooks/Baseline.ipynb`

For this classification task, we used a pre-trained model (VGG16) stacked with a fully connected layer of 128 units. The most of the VGG16 layers are freezed, except the last convulutional block (3 layers of Conv2D + 1 layer of maxpooling) is set to be trainable (to prevent overfitting).

The model was trained on 471 images from 4 classes.

The accuracy is 100% (from the unseen test data set).


## Serving
Users can call the `classify_doc_pic()` function in `/model/baseline_model.py` for classifying the doc-pic.
```python
classify_doc_pic('../../data/png/test/doc_template_04/doc_template_04.1507524410.1.html.png-clipped.png')

# output
# 1/1 [==============================] - 0s
# Out[167]:
# {'class_index': 3, 'class_name': 'doc_template_04'}
```


## TO-DOs
* [Done] Create a [few examples](https://github.com/mr5iff/doc-pic-classifier/tree/master/data/png)
* [Done] Make tensorflow to read the examples
* [Done] Baseline model
* [Done] Support more Document Templates (with other elements)
