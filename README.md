# doc-pic-classifier

## Problem
We want to build a model that can classify n types of Documents (in picture format), generated from Document Template. Each Document Template would have elements such as text blocks, input fields, image placeholders etc.

## Data
Input data is generated by [doc pic generator](https://github.com/mr5iff/doc-pic-classifier/tree/master/doc_pic_generator), it takes in jinja2 templates to generate html, and then further convert to png. Stored under data folder.

## Model
CNN in tensorflow, tbc

## Serving
tbc

## TO-DOs
* [Done] Create a [few examples](https://github.com/mr5iff/doc-pic-classifier/tree/master/data/png)
* Make tensorflow to read the examples
* Baseline model
* Support more Document Templates (with other elements)
* Serve with [TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/serving/)
